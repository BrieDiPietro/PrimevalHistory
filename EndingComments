v1#Gen.1.3#ἐγένετο#1: The parsing for "ἐγένετο" is simple: 3rd singular aorist middle indicative. 3rd singular is the simplest piece meaning simply the subject is a single being that is not the speaker or the reader. Aorist isn't complicated either, it's a simple past action, a thing happened. Indicative is also pretty simple. A thing is *actually* happening within reality.
Middle is where things start to get a little bit messy, but still makes sense. The middle form has complicated meanings with some verbs, but γίγνομαι is not one of these verbs. The LSJ entry for γίγνομαι is like the phonebook, but it doesn't give anything about middle meanings being different. The aorist of γίγνομαι is essentially "came to pass," "was created," or "came to be." Frequently, the LXX uses ἐγένετο as though it means simply "happened."
v1#Gen.1.3#ἐγένετο#2: I'd like to make the argument that ἐγένετο is so much more than "he/she/it was." It has an element of creation. ἐγένετο is the verb for birth. For production. For becoming. God speaks light into existence using this verb, but later it's used as "it was." That's such a huge difference. I want to acknowledge that the LXX used ἐγένετο almost interchangeably with an assumed εἰμι. I'm unsure as to why or what nuance this plays in the text, whether it's that the creation wasn't as valuable as I'd think, whether smaller things (like the passing of evening) are actually very important, or if there's an element of context lost to time. I've translated throughout as I saw fit, if there should be an element of creation in the sentence I've placed it. At some points I had to comply with common English ideas and left the powerful verb as "it was."
