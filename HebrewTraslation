Hebrew Translation

Chapter 1
At first, God created the heavens and the earth.
The earth was formless and empty and darkness [was] over the face of the abyss. The breath of God was brooding over the face of the waters.
Then God said "Let there be light" and there was light.
God saw the light, that [it was] good, and God separated the light and the darkness.
God called to the light day and the dark [he] called night. It was evening and it was morning, day one.
Then God said "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it be a separation between the waters and the waters.
God made the expanse and [He] separated between the waters which [were] below the expanse and the waters which [were] above the expanse. It came to be.
God called the expanse sky. It was evening and it was morning, the second day.
Then God said "Let the waters from under the heavens come together into one place and let the dry land appear." It came to be.
God called the dry land earth and the gathering of the waters [He] called seas. God saw that [it was] good.
Then God said "Let the earth sprout plants yielding seed and fruit trees yielding seed of every type on the earth." It came to be.
The earth brought forth plants yielding seed and fruit trees yielding seed of every type on the earth. God saw it [was] good.
It was evening and it was morning, third day.
Then God said "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.
Let them serve as lights in the expanse of the heavens to light over the earth." It came to be.
God made both of the great lights, the great light for ruling the day and the little light for ruling the night and the stars.
God placed them [stars, great light, and little light] in the expanse of the heavens to be lights upon the earth
and to rule over the day and the night and to separate between the light and the darkness. God saw that [it was] good.
It was evening and it was morning, fourth day.
Then God said "Let the waters team with swarms of living creatures and let the birds fly above the earth, across the expanse of the heavens."
God made the great sea monsters and all the living creatures. [He made] the things which crawl, [the things which] swarm the earth [according] to their kinds, and all the flying birds [according] to type. God saw that [it was] good.
God blessed them saying "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the bird multiply on the earth."
It was evening and it was morning, fifth day.
Then God said "Let the earth bring out living things [according] to kind, livestock and creeping things and living things of the earth [according] to kind." It came to be.
God made the wild things of the earth [according] to their kinds and the domestic things [according] to their kinds and all of the creeping thing[s] of the ground [according] to their kinds. God saw that [it was] good.
Then God said "Let us make human kind in our image according to our likeness and let them rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the domestic animals and all of the earth and all of the creeping things of the earth."
Then God created man, in His image. In the image of God He created him [man]. Male and female He created them.
God blessed them and God said to them "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird[s] of the heavens and over all of the creeping things on the earth."
God said "Here I have given you all the plants yielding seed, all which is on the face of the earth, and all of the trees which produce seed bearing fruit. It will be for food.
and all of the wild animals of the earth and all the bird of the sky and all the creeping things on the earth, [all] which in it [is] a living breath, all green plants [I have given] for food." It came to be.
God saw all which he made and indeed [it was] very good. There was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
