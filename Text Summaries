Text Summaries

** *Slaying The Dragon* Batto **
euhemerism: technical term referring to the attempt to discover the human precursor to deities

 ****Chapter 1: Mythopoeic Speculation in Babylon****
- Ancient Israel same process as other ancient Near East
- Gilgamesh of Uruk circa 2700-2500 BCE
- Gilgamesh continues through next 1500 years or so in many stories
- Old Babylonian author, not editor
- Sumerian motifs woven into new themes surrounding mortality
- multiple stories
- multitext tradition, it's like the Latin Iliad that James did
- embrace reality!
- Gilgamesh is the other flood story, original flood story
- Utnapishtim (Babylonian) to Atrahasis (Akkadian) to Noah (Israelite)
- long discussion of Atrahasis, but very repetitive of previous content, but with new characters
*skip over the immortality of Adam and what not
- argument that humans are created essentially as slaves across the stories
*issue with this argument, turtles all the way down
- do the gods actually eat offerings?
- underlying theme across versions to discourage rebellion "innovative"
- Enuma Elish, very intertwined with Akkadian
- works to predate the Akkadian version in cosmology
- how the world came to be, no better- how the gods came to be
- my main man Marduk
- consolidation of gods toward more monotheism ("god of trees" turns into Marduk of trees)
- show off monarchy (Hammurapi)
*issue with this argument
- certain stories are molded because certain regions grow/gain power
*i mean sure but thats a correlation not causation, right?
- religio-politico-literary climates of regions changed


 ****Chapter 2: The Yahwist's Primeval Myth****
- Part of the *Documental Hypothesis* of the Pentateuch
- flawed but makes the most sense
- Thesis: consider the J form; next chapter discuss how it was totally changed
- The J writer: from S Kingdom (Judah) probably about the time of David (about 1000 BCE)
- at minimum: Eden, Cain and Abel, Lamech, flood (6:1-8:22 (J and P intertwined)), drunk Noah, Tower of Babel, call of Abraham
- looking at just these creates a unified cohesive story
- "highly creative genius who reshaped prior mythic traditions" pg 44
- Yahwist focused on the story of sin (the Fall) and redemption (Abraham)
*Continuously improved creation*
- Scribal schools could've played a big role in teaching the writing style and the myths themselves
***Inchoate Creation***
- barren desert and primeval flood/ocean: completely uninhabitable
- symbols of nonexistence or chaos
- placement of Eden pg 49: 4 rivers (1 of which isn't real) abundance, luxury, paradise
- Semitic root ׁ'dn is the "abundance"
- creation is a process of "trial and error" pg 50
- man and soil are inherently connected in word as well in intention/work to till the ground
- "function of humankind was divine service" pg 51
- Yahwist/Atrahasis direct comparisons
- humans fall short -> from the ground, till the ground, the ground cries out
- humanity falls between deity and animal, but they aren't really sure where
- "primeval human" not a real modern human
*then what exactly happens
- in changing Adam to Adam/Eve it was reshaping the whole into complementary halves
- reaffirmed in marriage, this is the separation from animals
* there is actually no argument here, he's just making claims
- Gligamesh "humanization" in sex and clothing
- Gods wear clothing
- clothing isn't a covering because naked is bad; it's a step toward divinity after knowing the God wears clothes
*why is this still here if the Priestly wants to get rid of the anthropomorphic God
- destined to have eternal life until they became all knowing
- Tree of Wisdom isn't seen in other Near Eastern myth, but the gods are regularly associated with being wise based on their names especially
- "good and evil" = "Α to Ω" or "all things"
- serpent encouraging eating = Gilgamesh "don't eat of the bread, for it is the bread of death"
- Yahwist portrays God "as innocently mistaken" as with his creation
*So many problems
- sin rebellion: God created man with a piece of Himself, so humanity strives for divine, but shouldn't have it so cast out of the garden (equal to famine, plague, disease)
***Toward a Solution***
- first thing's first: sex
- creation with the help of Yahweh
- sin continuing down hill
- skims over Nephilim like it's super simple and makes perfect sense
    - it seems way more intertwined than influential like he claims
    - where did they come from?
    - who were they?
    - why were they?
    - it's great that it makes sense that God was mad though
- the flood killed off the sinful ones to create a new less divine humanity
- Noah's sacrifice symbolic of humanity's place in the universe- submitting to God
***Conclusion***
- original story based on what the people believed
- becomes the Israelite epic
*issue with ordering
- God learned from His mistakes
*super problematic

 ****Chapter 3: The Priestly Revision of the Creation Myth****
- Batto is a crazy person
- The Priestly Writer should be considered "the author" of a whole new thing
- wrote out of the Babylonian Exile
- reaffirm faith and edit to deal with current faith needs

****Chapter 4:Genesis I****
the world is not created, but fashioned, kind of
***Genesis 1:1***
in depth analysis of in the beginning
- it's an overdramatic attempt at being different and making a discovery
- more of a preamble
- Genesis and Egypt, together forever
- lots of ways of saying "at that time before now when a thing started to happen"
- what's a passive undersubject
- separation, an intentional division like a body (Tiamat)

in depth analysis of do/make
- creation first and foremost is about separation
- bring something into "functional existence"
- functional is KEY
- to do and to make are super closely related in ancient thought, way different than now
- no clear way of saying do a function versus make a material
- a lot of the time it's even just supervising a making process

***Genesis 1:2 and the Precosmic Condition***
- darkness is the before shot
- world lacking function and identity, not empty
- some difference among ancient sources but basically it's always a blob of water
- Egyptian concept of *nonexistence* is pretty close
- Egypt and Genesis together forever
        Egyptian language, Mesopotamian concepts?
- cosmic water is like a raging black ocean
- "The Israelite portrayal does not present the precreation state as negative or personal/personified; instead, it is a neutral, functionless ambiguity." pg145
- the whole deal on ruach
- over the water refers to a bird over a nest in a few other places
- "arena of discourse is shared by the Israelite and Egyptian environments, but the particulars have a shape unique to each tradition" pg149
- more Egypt than Mesopotamian
*please fight Batto*

***Days 1–3 (Genesis 1:3–13)***
analysis of the creation of time
- separate not against
- phenomena of periods, no t really light v. dark, but period of light to period of dark
** - cosmic geography
- flattening out is the root of creating the firmament
- def not clouds
- solid sky, not a floaty magic thing
- floaty magic thing is the expanse/firmament in the middle
- multiple layers like Egypt? that's why plural
- world in a box concept
- none of creation in Genesis is really new or innovative, it's just a new role for the deity
- "creation is an order- ing activity rather than a manufacturing enterprise" pg162

** *“GARDEN IN EDEN” OR “PARADISE OF DELIGHT”? THE SEPTUAGINT’S RENDERING OF עדן IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS* Ausloos **
- translators are "interpreters of the text"
- Hebrew and Greek "differ on a so-called graphemic level" pg 7
- verbal systems are super different which makes things hard
- lexical issues from Hebrew to Greek to German to English to any language
- he wrote a bigger book
- different translators have different takes on how "Eden" or "עךו" should be translated: place or status
- these aren't mutually exclusive
- Traduttore traditore: A translator is a traitor (Italian saying)
- very simplistic
- maybe cite as a sort of intro?

** *Allegorical Interpretation of Genesis II:I-XV* Philo**
- God is singular; nothing is equal or greater; nothing would possibly be joined when lesser
- Human is compound
- two kinds of men: those in the image God and those out of the earth


---
** *Early Greek Myth* Timothy Gantz**
- there isn't really any solid story
- there's not really even an oral tradition that we can confirm
- very inconsistent across creation
- it takes a few generations of gods for things to get more firm
- you'd assume a multitext tradition, but there's not even that
- Homer (Odyssey, barely) and Hesiod (Theogony) are the main sources
-  Lost work would be great Titanomachia
- Pherekydes of Syros' is based more on new philosophy, not keeping old tradition
- foundation in chaos, same as Mesopotamia
- follow with earth/sky same way, but still no consistenty
- "snake, guardian of the apples"
- tree imagery in a beautiful heavenly garden
