Text Summaries

** *Slaying The Dragon* Batto **
euhemerism: technical term referring to the attempt to discover the human precursor to deities

 ****Chapter 1: Mythopoeic Speculation in Babylon****
- Ancient Israel same process as other ancient Near East
- Gilgamesh of Uruk circa 2700-2500 BCE
- Gilgamesh continues through next 1500 years or so in many stories
- Old Babylonian author, not editor
- Sumerian motifs woven into new themes surrounding mortality
- multiple stories
- multitext tradition, it's like the Latin Iliad that James did
- embrace reality!
- Gilgamesh is the other flood story, original flood story
- Utnapishtim (Babylonian) to Atrahasis (Akkadian) to Noah (Israelite)
- long discussion of Atrahasis, but very repetitive of previous content, but with new characters
*skip over the immortality of Adam and what not
- argument that humans are created essentially as slaves across the stories
*issue with this argument, turtles all the way down
- do the gods actually eat offerings?
- underlying theme across versions to discourage rebellion "innovative"
- Enuma Elish, very intertwined with Akkadian
- works to predate the Akkadian version in cosmology
- how the world came to be, no better- how the gods came to be
- my main man Marduk
- consolidation of gods toward more monotheism ("god of trees" turns into Marduk of trees)
- show off monarchy (Hammurapi)
*issue with this argument
- certain stories are molded because certain regions grow/gain power
*i mean sure but thats a correlation not causation, right?
- religio-politico-literary climates of regions changed


 ****Chapter 2: The Yahwist's Primeval Myth****
- Part of the *Documental Hypothesis* of the Pentateuch
- flawed but makes the most sense
- Thesis: consider the J form; next chapter discuss how it was totally changed
- The J writer: from S Kingdom (Judah) probably about the time of David (about 1000 BCE)
- at minimum: Eden, Cain and Abel, Lamech, flood (6:1-8:22 (J and P intertwined)), drunk Noah, Tower of Babel, call of Abraham
- looking at just these creates a unified cohesive story
- "highly creative genius who reshaped prior mythic traditions" pg 44
- Yahwist focused on the story of sin (the Fall) and redemption (Abraham)
*Continuously improved creation*
- Scribal schools could've played a big role in teaching the writing style and the myths themselves
***Inchoate Creation***
- barren desert and primeval flood/ocean: completely uninhabitable
- symbols of nonexistence or chaos
- placement of Eden pg 49: 4 rivers (1 of which isn't real) abundance, luxury, paradise
- Semitic root ׁ'dn is the "abundance"
- creation is a process of "trial and error" pg 50
- man and soil are inherently connected in word as well in intention/work to till the ground
- "function of humankind was divine service" pg 51
- Yahwist/Atrahasis direct comparisons
- humans fall short -> from the ground, till the ground, the ground cries out
- humanity falls between deity and animal, but they aren't really sure where
- "primeval human" not a real modern human
*then what exactly happens
- in changing Adam to Adam/Eve it was reshaping the whole into complementary halves
- reaffirmed in marriage, this is the separation from animals
* there is actually no argument here, he's just making claims
- Gligamesh "humanization" in sex and clothing
- Gods wear clothing
- clothing isn't a covering because naked is bad; it's a step toward divinity after knowing the God wears clothes
*why is this still here if the Priestly wants to get rid of the anthropomorphic God
- destined to have eternal life until they became all knowing
- Tree of Wisdom isn't seen in other Near Eastern myth, but the gods are regularly associated with being wise based on their names especially
- "good and evil" = "Α to Ω" or "all things"
- serpent encouraging eating = Gilgamesh "don't eat of the bread, for it is the bread of death"
- Yahwist portrays God "as innocently mistaken" as with his creation
*So many problems
- sin rebellion: God created man with a piece of Himself, so humanity strives for divine, but shouldn't have it so cast out of the garden (equal to famine, plague, disease)
***Toward a Solution***
- first thing's first: sex
- creation with the help of Yahweh
- sin continuing down hill
- skims over Nephilim like it's super simple and makes perfect sense
    - it seems way more intertwined than influential like he claims
    - where did they come from?
    - who were they?
    - why were they?
    - it's great that it makes sense that God was mad though
- the flood killed off the sinful ones to create a new less divine humanity
- Noah's sacrifice symbolic of humanity's place in the universe- submitting to God
***Conclusion***
- original story based on what the people believed
- becomes the Israelite epic
*issue with ordering
- God learned from His mistakes
*super problematic

 ****Chapter 3: The Priestly Revision of the Creation Myth****
- Batto is a crazy person
- The Priestly Writer should be considered "the author" of a whole new thing
- wrote out of the Babylonian Exile
- reaffirm faith and edit to deal with current faith needs
