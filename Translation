Hebrew Translation: and God called to the light day and to the dark [he] called night and it was evening and it was morning, day one.

Genesis.1.6
English: And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”

Hebrew Translation: and God said let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it there be a separation between the waters and the waters.

English: And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
Greek:  καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ στερέωμα, καὶ διεχώρισεν ὁ θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ ὕδατος, ὃ ἦν ὑποκάτω τοῦ στερεώματος, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ἐπάνω τοῦ στερεώματος.

Hebrew Translation: and God made the expanse and [He] separated between the waters which [were] from below the expanse and between the waters which [were] above the expanse and so it came to be.
Notes:
- firmament/separator in Greek
- the Greek lacks so much parallelism

English: And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

Hebrew Translation: and God said let the waters from under the heavens come together into one place and let the dry land appear and so it came to be.
Notes:
- awkward pulling the water together in Greek

Genesis.1.10
English: God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
Greek: καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ θεὸς τὴν ξηρὰν γῆν καὶ τὰ συστήματα τῶν ὑδάτων ἐκάλεσεν θαλάσσας. καὶ εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς ὅτι καλόν.

Greek: καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεός Βλαστησάτω ἡ γῆ βοτάνην χόρτου, σπεῖρον σπέρμα κατὰ γένος καὶ καθ᾿ ὁμοιότητα, καὶ ξύλον κάρπιμον ποιοῦν καρπόν, οὗ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ κατὰ γένος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως.

Hebrew Translation: and God said Let us make human kind in our image according to our likeness and let them rule the fish of the sea and the bird of the heavens and the domestic animals and all of the earth and all of the creeping things that creep of the earth.
Notes:
- subjunctive ποιέω
- pattern?
- image isn't definite
- many sources insert the wild animals

Genesis.1.27
English: So God created man in his own image,	in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Greek: καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, κατ᾿ εἰκόνα θεοῦ ἐποίησεν αὐτόν, ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς.

Hebrew Translation: and God created man, in His image. and in the image of God He created him [man]. male and female He created them

- image isn't definite!
- noun vs adj of man and woman
